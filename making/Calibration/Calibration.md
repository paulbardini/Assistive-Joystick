The unit is together, but you may fing that the buttons and the printed upper body do not contact, and therefore work.
This is due to the fact that not all printers, print the same. 

Therefore - it may seem a bit strange, but I found a glue gun and side cutters fix this problem.

Take a glue gun and add a dab of glue on top for all the buttons. Don't go over board, just enough to create a small bump.

Use some side cutters to trim the glue. This worked really well for my print. You may need to play around with this.

While you have the gun gun in hand, glue in the cable and the lid closed.
