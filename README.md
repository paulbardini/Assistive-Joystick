><b>This device was created for a person with Guillian-Barre syndrome(https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/guillain-barre-syndrome) - causing nervous system inflammation and temporary paralysis. 
As they where being rehabilitated, this device could allow them to interact with a computer.</b>
><b>The large button on the back of the device allows the user to use the palm for the mouse click. 
Also the side button are facilitated by squeezing the device.</b>
><b>A new finger rest was designed to replace the existing joystick knob, allowing the two or three fingers to move the joystick. 
This minimises the fatigue with user.</b>
><b>Arduino micro controller and stock (very accessible) joystick parts and switches where used for other to replicate the device</b>

Research Description
This research seeks to better understand the open source framework and how it can be incorporated within the creative arts field to further innovation.
Open source is a paradigm of open collaboration and sharing, where ideas are developed within communities. These communities allow their ideas to be freely available for anyone to replicate, adapt or innovate upon the initial concept. Open source is commonly associated with the computer industry and is often misunderstood to be 'free and accessible software' however, this definition is limited. Open source, correctly framed, is the dissemination of knowledge, an ideology of openness, transparency and innovation.
To create an understanding of how ideas can be disseminated within the open communities, this research project seeks to experiment with an online collaboration platform called Github, (https://github.com). This platform, traditionally used within software development, allows users to publicly share their work, encouraging collaboration and potential innovation. Although the GitHub is being utilised within other disciplines, outside of software, there is great scope to investigate how the creative arts can benefit from this established and tested platform.   
The intention is to use GitHub to disseminate current and future project information, in order to investigate:
-	How people use this information.  Whether the published information is replicated or modified.
-	Ways in which this information is modified. Is the information used in unintentional ways?
GitHub structure allows the research to 
-	Communicate research objectives and information to participation. GiHub facilitates a comprehensive licencing protocol, allowing users to establish licencing agreements, this will also enable the communication of research intentions and information to participants about their involvement within the research project.
-	Follow peoples use of the information (within the constraints of the GitHub platform). Through built in analytics, traffic to GitHub can be tracked and reported.
-	GitHub has built in chat, commenting and wiki facilities to collaborate with participants. As it is a membership based platform, members can be easily identified and contacted.
