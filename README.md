# Assistive-Joystick for finite hand movement.
[google](http//google.com/)
### This joystick was created as an alternative computer mouse to help a sick family friend. 

### After battling Guillian-Barre syndrome with a short-term period in induced coma, my friend’s rehabilitation required to re-learn basic hand movements and other physical activities which many of us take for granted.

### This joystick was designed to sit in the hand while lying in bed. The large button on top of the device reduces the amount of effort required to perform a mouse click, while the joystick creates a more function method of positioning the mouse cursor.

### Apart from helping out a friend, I want this project to be released to the community, within an open source ideology. I hope that this may be helpful for others in similar situation, or could be used in ways that are not intended here.

### Please – take this idea and recreated it. Modify/redesign it to be used for an alternative reason.  With the help of an open community, this project could assist many people in need.

><b>The large button on the back of the device allows the user to use their palm for the mouse click. 
Also the side buttons are facilitated by squeezing the device.</b>
><b>A new finger rest was designed to replace the existing joystick knob, allowing the two or three fingers to move the joystick. 
This minimises the fatigue of the user.</b>

##### THIS IS AN ONGOING PROJECT AND I AM ASKING FOR HELP TO FURTHER THIS TECHNOLOGY.
##### PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A UNIVERSITY RESEARCH PROJECT - PLEASE READ THE FOLLOW ETHIC PROTOCOLS.

##### Research Description
This research seeks to better understand the open source framework and how it can be incorporated within the creative arts field to further innovation.
Open source is a paradigm of open collaboration and sharing, where ideas are developed within communities. These communities allow their ideas to be freely available for anyone to replicate, adapt or innovate upon the initial concept. Open source is commonly associated with the computer industry and is often misunderstood to be 'free and accessible software.' However, this definition is limited. Open source, correctly framed, is the dissemination of knowledge, an ideology of openness, transparency and innovation.
To create an understanding of how ideas can be disseminated within the open communities, this research project seeks to experiment with an online collaboration platform called Github, (https://github.com). This platform, traditionally used within software development, allows users to publicly share their work, encouraging collaboration and potential innovation. Although the GitHub is being utilised within other disciplines outside of software, there is great scope to investigate how the creative arts can benefit from this established and tested platform.   
The intention is to use GitHub to disseminate current and future project information, in order to investigate:
-	How people use this information.  Whether the published information is replicated or modified.
-	Ways in which this information is modified. Is the information used in unintentional ways?
GitHub structure allows the research to 
-	Communicate research objectives and information to participation. GitHub facilitates a comprehensive licencing protocol, allowing users to establish licencing agreements. This will also enable the communication of research intentions and information to participants about their involvement within the research project.
-	Follow people's use of the information (within the constraints of the GitHub platform). Through built-in analytics, traffic to GitHub can be tracked and reported.
-	GitHub has built-in chat, commenting and wiki facilities to collaborate with participants. As it is a membership based platform, members can be easily identified and contacted.

##### Participatory information.
THIS GITHUB REPOSITORY IS A UNIVERSITY RESEARCH PROJECT
